# Pomodoro
This is a simple Pomodor clock and To-Do list. It was a fun build, and my attempt
at doing a full design from the ground up on my own. Designed the project in Figma
and tossed it together with Vue.js.

## What is the Pomodoro technique?
I'm not an expert in it, so let me tell you what I know, and if I have something wrong
please open an issue and let me know.

Pomodoro is basically a time management technique of taking frequent breaks at specific
intervals. I use the figures of 25 minutes work, 5 minute short breaks, and 15 minute long breaks.

You do 4 iterations of Work -> Short Break (known as a Pomodoro), after your final short break
you do another iteration of Work, but move to a Long Break. Once you've completed your long break,
the Pomodoro counter resets, and you start over.

## What font are you using?
The font name is ["Digital Dismay"](https://www.dafont.com/digital-dismay.font) by Andrew McCluskey (nal@nalgames.com). I like
the old style clock look, and wanted to bring that to this design. All other fonts
are Google Fonts which can be found in the code.
